// NEXT-08: payment instruction resolution and replacement, extending the
// existing supplier payment-batch/export owner.
//
// A resolution frees instruction capacity after proof that the instruction did
// not execute. It posts no journal, changes no payable allocation and moves no
// money; the packet's atomic scope is reservation release, dispatch fencing
// and the receipt, and it all happens in one non-journal transaction.
//
// The honest state of this owner, recorded here because it determines what is
// built: **no proof branch is currently satisfiable, and the owner is written
// to say so rather than to manufacture one.** The leaf's release and proof
// evaluators are therefore not called here; they activate the day an exclusive
// channel record or a provider-authenticated cancellation is retained, and
// until then importing them would be a claim of composition without one. What
// is composed today is the replacement compiler, which executes on every
// replacement attempt and refuses honestly while no effective release exists.
//
// The leaf refuses an operator-reported rejection outright — "An
// operator-reported rejection is not external no-execution proof" — so a
// retained rejection rules nothing in and nothing out. It sits in the outcome
// inventory where the next reader can see it, and the instruction stays
// reserved. The controlled-never-dispatched branch needs an exclusive channel
// control record, a dispatch fence and a revocation, none of which exists: our
// exports are retrievable files, so the bytes are exposed by construction. The
// provider-cancellation branch needs a retained provider-authenticated
// response with a contract version, and no such caller exists here.
//
// What the owner therefore does today, and what is fully exercised: derive the
// instruction per export item from retained bytes, read the retained outcome
// chain, refuse a settled instruction, record unknown with the exact missing
// proof, enforce same-key replay, refuse a different key over the same state,
// and gate replacement on an effective release that cannot yet exist. When an
// exclusive channel record or a provider-authenticated cancellation arrives,
// either branch activates without rewriting this owner, because the proof
// evaluation reads retained evidence rather than asserting it.
