// NEXT-16: the period-work application owner.
//
// Evidence-aware period preparation over the operations that already own each
// economic effect. This owner posts nothing itself. It freezes a selection,
// routes each child to the operation that already owns that effect, records
// exactly what happened, and presents a fixed manifest for one human approval.
//
// The rules that shape every operation here:
//
//   - A queue claim belongs to effect-mq. A child revision fence is what stops a
//     redelivered handler publishing a result twice, and the fence is a database
//     column compared in the UPDATE's WHERE clause, not an in-memory flag.
//   - The owning prepare and execute operations are called OUTSIDE any
//     transaction this owner holds. They open their own, so holding one here
//     would nest a second financial transaction, which the repository forbids.
//     A child is therefore claimed in one short transaction and checkpointed in
//     another, and a crash between them is repaired by the stable command key.
//   - A batch approval covers exactly the sealed members it lists. It never
//     covers a later arrival, and it is never an ordinary-agent power.
//   - A child whose financial effect depends on an unknown predecessor cannot
//     enter a preapproved batch. It is prepared after the predecessor commits.
//   - A cancellation after preparation keeps the prepared plan as retained
//     evidence but prevents the stale handler publishing new work.
