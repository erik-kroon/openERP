/**
 * What the queue already did to one durable record, and what the dispatcher may
 * do about it.
 *
 * Every job kind here carries a deterministic idempotency key, so the store
 * admits a repeat with `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` and reports it as a duplicate.
 * That is right for a redelivery and wrong for a recovery: after its attempts are
 * spent a job row is terminally `failed`, and every later enqueue is a silent
 * no-op that changes nothing and is reported nowhere. A dispatcher that only
 * enqueues therefore stops delivering while its own claim query keeps selecting
 * the intent forever, and for supplier extraction a reviewed counter grows until
 * its ceiling stops the claim transaction for every other request in the
 * installation.
 *
 * So the dispatcher reads the queue state and decides. It never acknowledges an
 * intent: acknowledgement is the statement that the effect happened, and only the
 * owning operation knows that.

 * asymmetric: a needless retry costs a bounded wait, while a wrongly abandoned
 * attempt loses work that a human or a later state could still have completed.
 *
 * `Unavailable` and `InternalError` are transient by construction. `NotFound` can
 * be a claim race against a record that exists. `StaleDependency` and
 * `PeriodLocked` resolve on their own. `MissingEvidence` and `ApprovalRequired`
 * resolve when a human acts, and the same intent is still the right place to

 * and is left to the budget rather than turned into a delivery failure.
